# Invisibooks

My final project for my Ironhack Bootcamp - a single-page Web application built using MongoDB, Express, React & Node.js. Invisibooks is a web app that allows users to give away and trade books, without ever giving away the name or author of the book - Users can get something new to read, without the paralysing burden of choice

The project was created in 6 days, at the end of the 9 week bootcamp, though we only began working with React the 2 weeks before beginning the project. It's still pretty rough around the edges, but I am very proud of what I accomplished in this short amount of time with my very limited knowledge beforehand. 

I plan to continue developing this project soon - you can see the features and styling changes i'm planning on implementing below.

The project also involved a lot of learning on the go & learning from mistakes - as such, the code is definitely not as clean or as optimised as I would like.

## Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jcekelly/Invisibooks.git
```

```bash
$ npm install
```
```bash
$ npm start
```

```bash
$ cd client
```
```bash
$ npm run build
```

## Features In-Progress or Planned

- Users can only request a book once they've added a book of their own 
- Filters on browse page
- An edit button on user's added books
- Random book button
- ‘how it works’ pop up after sign-up

### Planned Style Changes

- Book cards react under hover
- Request form opens in a pop-up, rather than dedicated page 
- diversify styling & colour scheme
